# vector-field-dynamics

Interactive, web-based simulation that visualizes the dynamics of particles moving through customizable vector fields, with controls for field type, particle behavior, and visual representation.

The vector field simulator supports the following predefined fields:
- Vortex: Particles swirl around the center.
- Sink: Particles flow inward towards the center.
- Source: Particles flow outward from the center.
- Uniform Flow: Particles move in a straight line across the screen.
- Dipole: A more complex field combining a source and a sink.
- Saddle Point: Particles are drawn in along one axis and pushed out along another.
- Custom: Option that allows you to define your own vector field using mathematical expressions for the X and Y velocity components.
